- [x] Basin Rendering... See BlockModelShapes, ModelLoaderRegistry. Going to use Multipart models and Data Generators, E.g. split model into basin part (which will be static) and water part (which is generated). Create properties in Basin Block to expose water level, etc. Custom IStateMapper?
- [x] Spinning Wheel Block: Interacted w/ through right clicks. A spindle must be added first, then a certain amount of fiber. Afer this, right clicking spins the wheel. After a certain amount of spinning, the spindle becomes full and a thread item can be extracted. Multi-models and blockstates can be used to render varying levels of fiber and a spindle.
- [x] Color Word Localization
- [x] Better Mixing Algorithm
- [ ] Add Feature to boost Basin color saturation. Player can add one glowstone dust which boosts the basin's color saturation.
- [ ] Drafting Table
- [ ] Embroidery Table?
- [ ] Ability to dye fabric
- [ ] Pattern items
- [x] Rewrite BasinTile using FSM
- [x] Rewrite SpinningWheel using FSM
- [x] Fiber Items
- [x] Brush Item
- [x] Item Color Helper
- [ ] Fabric Item: Looks like ItemOverrideList can be used to override an Item's model dynamically. Will probably have to create a custom Model and ModelLoader class. Consult DynamicBucketModel. Might create a new Atlas for patterns and such. Color different layers using Item Color. Note: Item Models don't generate their texture locations. I was being silly. We will also have to register the ModelLoader. This can be done using ModelLoaderRegistry, and should be performed during the ModelRegistryEvent. The fabric item also needs to be hooked up to the ModelLoader, which is accomplished in the item's JSON model file. https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.15.x/src/main/resources/assets/forge/models/item/bucket.json

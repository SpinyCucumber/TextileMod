- [x] Spinning Wheel Block: Interacted w/ through right clicks. A spindle must be added first, then a certain amount of fiber. Afer this, right clicking spins the wheel. After a certain amount of spinning, the spindle becomes full and a thread item can be extracted. Multi-models and blockstates can be used to render varying levels of fiber and a spindle.

- [ ] Fabric Item: Looks like ItemOverrideList can be used to override an Item's model dynamically. Will probably have to create a custom Model and ModelLoader class. Consult DynamicBucketModel. Might create a new Atlas for patterns and such. Color different layers using Item Color. Note: Item Models don't generate their texture locations. I was being silly.

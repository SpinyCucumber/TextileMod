- [x] Basin Rendering... See BlockModelShapes, ModelLoaderRegistry. Going to use Multipart models and Data Generators, E.g. split model into basin part (which will be static) and water part (which is generated). Create properties in Basin Block to expose water level, etc. Custom IStateMapper?
- [x] Spinning Wheel Block: Interacted w/ through right clicks. A spindle must be added first, then a certain amount of fiber. Afer this, right clicking spins the wheel. After a certain amount of spinning, the spindle becomes full and a thread item can be extracted. Multi-models and blockstates can be used to render varying levels of fiber and a spindle.

	- [ ] Allow patterns to be "loaded." Patterns should be able to specify their layers in a JSON file, which is loaded during setup.
		- Minecraft has interfaces like "IResourceManager" and "ISelectiveResourceReloadListener" which handle loading resources. We should probably try to implement these to handle pattern loading. "LootTableManager" might be a good resource.
		- Since "Material" is client-side, we will need to separate out the texture map from FabricPattern, perhaps into another class. This is also going to complicate loading. We might end up needing two files for each pattern: one to specify the layer names, recipe, etc., and another to specify the textures.
		- The best solution going forward would be to separate FabricPattern into a FabricPattern class, which would only contain the list of layers, and a "FabricTextures" class, which would map layers to textures. The layers could be specified when constructing the FabricPattern, avoiding the need for a file, and the textures could be specified in a resource file. Note that the fabric textures aren't a model. FabricItemModel handles creating models of fabric items by using their textures. We're also going to need a place to store the fabric textures associated with each FabricPattern. ModelBakery seems to be a good resource.
		- ModelBakery, ModelLoader, and ModelManager and work in tandem. The difference isn't exactly but it seems that ModelBakery performs the actual work (mostly in the processLoading method) and that ModelManager handles reloading and such.
	- Looks like ItemOverrideList can be used to override an Item's model dynamically. Will probably have to create a custom Model and ModelLoader class. Might create a new Atlas for patterns and such. Color different layers using Item Color. Note: Item Models don't generate their texture locations. I was being silly.
	- We will also have to register the ModelLoader. This can be done using ModelLoaderRegistry, and should be performed during the ModelRegistryEvent. The fabric item also needs to be hooked up to the ModelLoader, which is accomplished in the item's JSON model file.
	- Dynamic Bucket Model is a good source for creating custom item models.
	- "NewModelLoaderTest" included in Forge 1.16 is also a good source.
	- There are several methods for displaying fabrics. One method, discussed above, is creating a custom item model that creates quads for each layer of the fabric. This would mean more quads. Another possible issue would be z-fighting between quads of different layers, since they all use the same mask. This could be resolved by creating a more specialized quad generator. Another method of displaying fabric would be to combine each layer into an individual texture, and this this texture to render the item. This has the advantage of using less quads, and it would also really simplify armor rendering. Since a texture has to be created for each fabric, however, it could slow down the GPU. It also isn't clear how exactly this would be accomplished. Seeing how Minecraft generates atlas textures would be a good place to start.

- [ ] Clothing
	- ArmorLayer might be a good place to start.
	- Forge provides a method in Item called getArmorModel, which allows items to handle their own armor rendering. This could allow a "clothing" item to define its own model. Armor is rendered using a BipedModel. BipedModel defines its own geometry, but it could probably be subclassed.
